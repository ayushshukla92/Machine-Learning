Hi,

After an extremely encouraging response to Super Webinar I in July, which saw participation from some top schools like Wharton, Duke, ISB & GMAC, we now present Super Webinar II, with another set of top schools.

This is a unique opportunity to interact with Officials/Alumni/Current Students from some of the top programs and gain useful insights on admission nuances, life during MBA, job prospects, financing options and anything else that may cross your mind. Additional session by EssaySunday Consulting for profile evaluation, school suggestions, application planning and long-term profile building.
